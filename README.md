# AeroFlight-Python-Kibana

AeroFlight Ltd. is a new charter company offering cheaper charted flights. They started trading in January 2020, and after a year of trading they decided to analyse the data they have gathered in order to make informed business and marketing decisions, and decide their strategy for the new year.
AeroFlight operates mainly from USA airports, but they look forward to extend their service to other locations. They have requested a report with KPI’s for their upcoming stakeholders’ meeting.
